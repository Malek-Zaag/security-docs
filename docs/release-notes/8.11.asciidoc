[[features-8.11.0]]
==== New features
* Upgrades {elastic-defend} for Windows to capture a new event type: ETW Threat Intelligence (ETW-TI). Renames the Windows events policy `Credential access` category to `API` in the UI (but not in the `.yaml`, maintaining backwards compatibility). Adds two new advanced options: `windows.advanced.events.api_disabled` and
`windows.advanced.events.api_verbose` ({pull}167549[#167549]).
* Adds the `Same family` category and tab to the Data Quality dashboard. Fields with mappings in the same family have the same search behavior as the type specified by ECS, but may have different space usage or performance characteristics ({pull}167480[#167480]).
* Updates the exceptions flyout's `match_any` operator to accept duplicate values that differ in case. Previously, values of `foo` and `FOO` were incorrectly considered duplicates ({pull}167208[#167208]).
* Enables the Elastic AI Assistant to answer questions about Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL) by allowing it to query, via ELSER, an ES|QL knowledge base. Refer to <<security-assistant, Elastic AI Assistant>> to enable the knowledge base ({pull}167097[#167097]).
* Enables ES|QL in Timeline (technical preview) ({pull}166764[#166764]).
* Adds the new ES|QL rule type (technical preview) ({pull}165450[#165450]).
* Implements Kafka output for {elastic-endpoint} (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint-dev/issues/13192[#13192]).
* Upgrades {elastic-endpoint} to support MacOS (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint-dev/issues/13058[#13058]).
